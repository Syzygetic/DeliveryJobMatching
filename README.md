# DeliveryJobMatching
This repository serves as a showcase for my capstone project, which revolves around leveraging Spectral Clustering to recommend and match publicly available delivery jobs that have not been assigned to any specific company. The goal is to assign these jobs to compatible and suitable companies based on their current portfolio of delivery jobs.
